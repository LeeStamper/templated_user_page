Create a templated user profile page in this rails app that looks like:

![carl sagan](/public/sagan.png)

Feel free to embellish this design as you like, but make sure to use Bootstrap. You'll need to add the following stylesheet link to the `application.html` file in the `views/layouts` folder. Make sure you add it above the `stylesheet_link_tag`:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">

Also add the following JavaScript. Make sure you include it below the `javascript_include_tag`:

    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

Use this video as a guide for the app's interaction:
